This Application is to allow participants who are to conduct a health survey register with username password and invitation code.
There will be 4 different surveys, of which one must be completed (Mag0) and 2 out of the other 3 must be completed. Therefore the survey 
consist of 3 surveys or in the test case 3 questions.

First surveys is always the one that is mandatory for all participants. Other 2 will be randomly chosen and randomly placed in order of
appearance.

For the test case only data that is saved to the database is registration information, login, placement of surveys for each participant.

For the test case the actual surveys themselves will not be evaluated for validity nor saved to database.

For the test case frontend ajax script is used to check if the username as already been saved in the database and to indicate in real time
after clicking on the next textbox.

This application therefore can be improved using frontend javascript and ajax instead of server side validation.

For the test case the look and feel are not important as long as it allows functionality.

For the test case, the surveys are within scope and same server, however, in real case that is not so. Therefore it is assumed that the
participant is redirected to the survey website with GET HTTP information and is returned to a particular page back to the server to allow
for the next question/survey. Therefore random.php page has been created for update function rather than a class user update function

header('location:http://mysurvey.server.domain.com/applicationsurvey?id=xxx&counter=x&study=Magx')

terminating link to survey must be
